Hello, I added new text content.
This txt file is for learning purposes.
I am learning about Git Branching today.

Added new text content for the second time.
This is for the purpose of checking the commit from the branch named "docs/add-new-text"

Added another entry using the main branch.

Created another branch called docs/new-content, then make changes to the main text file.
The purpose is to fully understand how branching works.
Do not make a conflict.
